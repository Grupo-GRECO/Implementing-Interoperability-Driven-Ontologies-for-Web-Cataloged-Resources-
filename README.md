This ontology project was designed by Vânia Borges in collaboration with Henrique Rodrigues and Eduardo Prata. The Work has been developed in the GRECO - Grupo de Engenharia do Conhecimento at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, in the PPGI - Programa de Pós-Graduação em Informática.

This project developed an ontology expansion to well describe repository (meta)data and implement FAIR principles, providing better interoperability and reuse.

This repository has the following contents:

DSpace_DCAT_UFO_MLT: Triples files with the ontologies and instances

EndML_Approach: Files used in the proposed approach

Publication Images: Images used in the paper under submission

VPP Diagram: The Visual Paradigm diagram with the main models
