This ontology project was designed by Vânia Borges de Jesus with collaboration with Henrique Rodrigues and Eduardo Prata. Work developed in the GRECO - Grupo de Engenharia do Conhecimento at the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, inside the PPGI - Programa de Pós-Graduação em Informática.

This project developed an ontology expansion to well describe repository (meta)data and implement FAIR principles, providing better interoperability and reuse.

This repository has the following contents:

DSpace_DCAT_UFO_MLT: Triples files with the ontologies and instances
EndML_Approach: Files used in the proposed approach
Publication Images: Images used in the paper under submission
VPP Diagram: The Visual Paradigm diagram of the ontology with changes
